TerminalX is a **modern and playful terminal concept** designed for fun, not functionality. Itâ€™s not a real-world replacement for traditional terminalsâ€”instead, it experiments with unique and gimmicky commands for an entertaining experience. Think of it as a terminal that doesnâ€™t take itself too seriously.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Clean, modern design** â€“ A sleek look that feels refreshing.
    
- **Fun Commands** â€“ Run quirky commands like `game play-pong` instead of standard terminal inputs.
    
- **Themes** â€“ Customize the look to match your vibe.

## Commands that are in the app

- help â†’ Lists all available commands but in a cool, animated way.

- about â†’ Displays TerminalXâ€™s backstory (you already have this).

- clear â†’ Clears the screen but with a cool fading animation.

- exit â†’ Closes TerminalX (or just hides it with a smooth transition).

- theme dark / theme light â†’ Switch between dark and light mode.

- flip â†’ Flips the entire terminal upside down for 5 seconds.

- selfdestruct â†’ A dramatic countdown, but nothing actually happens.

- owo â†’ Converts the entire terminal text into "OwO speak".

- time â†’ Displays the current time but in a stylish format.

- 404 â†’ Prints "Command not found, but what if it was never meant to be?"

- play [lofi/chillwave/synthwave] â†’ Starts background music if possible.
