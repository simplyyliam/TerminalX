TerminalX is a **modern and playful terminal concept** designed for fun, not functionality. Itâ€™s not a real-world replacement for traditional terminalsâ€”instead, it experiments with unique and gimmicky commands for an entertaining experience. Think of it as a terminal that doesnâ€™t take itself too seriously.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Clean, modern design** â€“ A sleek look that feels refreshing.
    
- **Fun Commands** â€“ Run quirky commands like `game play-pong` instead of standard terminal inputs.
    
- **Themes** â€“ Customize the look to match your vibe.

## Commands that are in the app

- TX help â†’ Lists all available commands but in a cool, animated way.

- Tx about â†’ Displays TerminalXâ€™s backstor.

- Tx clear â†’ Clears the screen but with a cool fading animation.
